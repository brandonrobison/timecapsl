                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded" align="justify">In late 2015, timecapsl co-founder Brandon Robison learned that his family had paid to have his grandfather professionally interviewed in 1982. The interview had focused on organizing his life experiences into a narrative that could be saved and shared with family members beyond his years. Because his grandfather had passed away when Brandon was only six years old, his curiosity was piqued, and he wanted to learn more about this important man that he had hardly known. However, curiosity quickly turned to disappointment as Brandon's father informed him that the interview had been recorded on cassette tapes and he was no longer sure if a copy still existed.</p>
					<p class="text-faded" align="justify">Brandon would not be deterred. He began contacting family members in his home state of Nevada. After many dead ends, he was extremely excited to learn that one of his aunts possessed a copy of the interview. While he was ecstatic to have discovered a copy of his grandfather's interview, his aunt was unwilling to ship the tape to him out of fear of losing this family treasure in the process. Shortly after, Brandon boarded a plane bound for Las Vegas and then drove several more hours to meet his aunt to pickup the tape.</p>
					<p class="text-faded" align="justify">After Brandon retrieved the recording, he began to listen to it and learned more about his grandfather. Given the age of the tape and the technology used, there were significant issues with the audio. Brandon transferred the interview to his computer and started doing what he could to clean it up and preserve his grandfather's life story to a more permanent format. And that's when he was struck with an idea...</p>
					<p class="text-faded" align="justify">Brandon shared his story and idea with his friend, and fellow co-founder, Elliott Griffin. Elliott had recently lost the only grandfather he had ever known in his life. Soon after that, he and his wife had celebrated the birth of their first child, a little girl named Evelyn. Elliott was saddened by the fact that Evelyn would never meet her great-grandfather, someone who had been such an important person in his own life. He had long regretted not taking advantage of the time they had together to capture his grandfather's amazing life story.</p>
					<p class="text-faded" align="justify">Brandon found closeness to a relative he had hardly known through an amazing set of circumstances, while Elliott recognized that he had missed an opportunity to share one of the most important people in his life with his daughter. In the gap between those two unique experiences, the necessity for a service that provides professional preservation of individual and family histories was revealed. Brandon and Elliott quickly set to work and the result of their collaboration is timecapsl.</p>

				<h3>Video Interviews</h3>
					<p align="justify" style="margin-right:20px;">Every life is unique and every life story is worth sharing. Our team has constructed hundreds of questions for our interviewers to choose from in order to guide an individual through their life in a well-paced, organized manner. Our goal is to form a narrative covering your life's most important moments, as well as capturing your worldview and perspective for future generations.</p>
					<p align="justify" style="margin-right:20px;">The timecapsl interview process begins with two critical exercises. The first is a simple questionnaire that helps loosely shape and define major moments and relationships in your life. From this exercise, our team will refine from our interview question universe a set specifically tailored to tell your life's story. The second is a short exercise designed to help the client think like a storyteller. Our lives are more than just a series of moments; they are the details and feelings behind those moments. The more depth and color you add to your retelling, the better, and this second exercise will help you begin to think in those terms.</p>
					<p align="justify" style="margin-right:20px;">After these exercises are completed, we will schedule an in-person interview. Our team will come to your home or another location of your choosing. Once there, it will take about an hour to setup the audio/visual equipment necessary to record the event. Our interviews typically last about three hours, but can vary widely depending upon the client. After the interview, we will require an additional two weeks to edit the raw footage into its final, produced form. You will be provided both a hard copy of the interview and access to a digital copy online of the interview upon completion of the editing process.</p>
					<p align="justify" style="margin-right:20px;">timecapsl video interviews begin at $1,495. If you have additional questions on the process, please do not hesitate to <a href="#contact" class="js-fancybox-close">call or email our team</a>.</p>

				<h3>Audio &amp; Video Digitization</h3>
					<p align="justify" style="margin-right:20px;">If your family is like ours, you have a dusty box tucked away somewhere filled with outmoded cassette and VHS tapes of all sizes and formats that contain recordings of recitals, Christmas mornings, birthdays, and more. Because these crucial memories are from a time long passed, the technology used to capture them is no longer current, and in many cases, flatly incompatible with what we currently use in our homes today. timecapsl offers a better way.</p>
					<p align="justify" style="margin-right:20px;">Our team will send a courier to personally pick up these precious audio and video recordings you have been saving and deliver them to our facility. Once there, we will transfer their contents onto our computers and use the latest technologies to clean up any audio or video defects possible. At this point, our clients have two options from which to choose. First, timecapsl can simply transfer the restored digital copy of audio and video onto back to you, along with your original cassettes. This option costs $100 per cassette.</p>
					<p align="justify" style="margin-right:20px;">Now, again, if your family is like ours, these cassettes will contain multiple events, sometimes spanning years. How many hours have we all spent searching for that one event buried somewhere on one of our old tapes? We've been there, too, and our second option--complete curation of your family video collection--ensures you never will again. After our team digitizes and restores your family memories, we will set up a phone consultation with you to discuss how best you would like us to organize the various events and memories you had previously captured. Would you like a disc that places every Christmas sequentially? We can do that. Would you like to organize everything onto discs by year? We can do that, too. We will edit, produce, and organize your old recordings in any way you want. The cost for option two is still $100 per cassette digitized, and an additional $50 an hour for the duration of the curation process. During our phone consultation we will provide an estimate of how many hours your vision will take for us to realize. Upon completion, we will provide you with the curated digital copies, as well as your original cassettes. <a href="#contact" class="js-fancybox-close">Contact us today</a> to get started or to get more information.</p>

				<h3>Photo &amp; Document Scanning</h3>
					<p align="justify" style="margin-right:20px;">Similar to our Audio & Video Digitization, timecapsl offers extremely high quality photo and document scanning services. Any precious moment caught on film, or an invaluable historical, legal, or sentimental document, should be reproduced in high-resolution digital form, adding a level of assurance and protection that they will never be lost due to a fire, flood, or other calamity.</p>
					<p align="justify" style="margin-right:20px;">Again, our team will send a professional courier to your door to pick up these items and deliver them directly to our facility where we will scan them at print-quality resolutions. Once completed, our team will transfer them digitally and deliver everything back to you safely. <a href="#contact" class="js-fancybox-close">Contact us today</a> to get started or to get more information.</p>

				<h3>Archival Service</h3>
					<p align="justify" style="margin-right:20px;">Archiving is the true cornerstone of timecapsl. Every service we offer is designed to protect your life's story and memories for the enjoyment of future generations of your family. Whether it is the in-depth personal interview in which your life's story is told, or the digitization of priceless recordings, videos, and photos, timecapsl exists to preserve and curate your digital legacy. However, even these items can be lost or destroyed. But not with our archival system.</p>
					<p align="justify" style="margin-right:20px;">With annual subscriptions of $115, the final product of any timecapsl service you choose will be stored online. Further, you will be provided a login to access the contents of your personal timecapsl from anywhere in the world. You may share that login with family and friends who can also enjoy everything within it as well. They can watch your personal interview, or any number of old family videos, or maybe just flip through photos from distant times. You will no longer have to worry about where you last placed something or the effects of any act of God. Your entire digital legacy will be preserved and protected online with immediate access. Guaranteed. <a href="#contact" class="js-fancybox-close">Contact us today</a> to get started or to get more information.</p>
