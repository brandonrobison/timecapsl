            <i class="fa fa-4x fa-diamond wow bounceIn text-primary" data-wow-delay=".3s"></i>
            <h3>video interviews</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Every life is unique and every life story is worth sharing. Our team has constructed hundreds of questions for our interviewers to choose from in order to guide an individual through their life in a well-paced, organized manner. Our goal is to form a narrative covering your life's most important moments, as well as capturing your worldview and perspective for future generations.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">The timecapsl interview process begins with two critical exercises. The first is a simple questionnaire that helps loosely shape and define major moments and relationships in your life. From this exercise, our team will refine from our interview question universe a set specifically tailored to tell your life's story. The second is a short exercise designed to help the client think like a storyteller. Our lives are more than just a series of moments; they are the details and feelings behind those moments. The more depth and color you add to your retelling, the better, and this second exercise will help you begin to think in those terms.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">After these exercises are completed, we will schedule an in-person interview. Our team will come to your home or another location of your choosing. Once there, it will take about an hour to setup the audio/visual equipment necessary to record the event. Our interviews typically last about three hours, but can vary widely depending upon the client. After the interview, we will require an additional two weeks to edit the raw footage into its final, produced form. You will be provided a hard copy of the interview. A digital copy would be available through our <a href="#timecapsl">timecapsl&trade;</a> service.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"><strong>Individual timecapsl video interviews begin at $1,495.</strong> Please <a href="index.html#contact">contact us</a> if you have additional questions about our process or if you are interested in discussing discounts for multiple interviews.</p>

            <h3>audio &amp; video digitization</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">If your family is like ours, you have a dusty box tucked away somewhere filled with outmoded cassette and VHS tapes of all sizes and formats that contain recordings of recitals, Christmas mornings, birthdays, and more. Because these crucial memories are from a time long-passed, the technology used to capture them is no longer current, and in many cases, flatly incompatible with what we currently use in our homes today. timecapsl offers a solution so you can revisit those memories any time.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Our team will send a courier to personally pick up these precious audio and video recordings you have been saving and deliver them to our facility. Once there, we will transfer their contents onto our computers and use the latest technologies to clean up any audio or video defects possible. At this point, our clients have two options from which to choose. First, timecapsl can simply transfer the restored audio and video back to you on a disk, along with your original cassettes. <strong>This option costs $100 per audio cassette or $150 per video cassette.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-justify">Now, again, if your family is like ours, these cassettes will contain multiple events, sometimes spanning years. How many hours have we all spent searching for that one event buried somewhere on one of our old tapes? We've been there, too, and our second option &mdash; complete curation of your family audio and video collection &mdash; ensures you never will again. After our team digitizes and restores your family memories, we will set up a phone consultation with you to discuss how best you would like us to organize the various events and memories you had previously captured. Would you like a disc that places every Christmas sequentially? We can do that. Would you like to organize everything onto discs by year? We can do that, too. We will edit, produce, and organize your old recordings in any way you want. <strong>The cost for option two is still $100 or $150 per cassette digitized, and an additional $50 an hour for the duration of the curation process.</strong> During our phone consultation we will provide an estimate of how many hours your vision will take for us to realize. Upon completion, we will provide you with the curated hard copies, as well as your original cassettes. <a href="index.html#contact">Contact us today</a> to get started or to get more information.</p>

            <h3>photo &amp; document scanning</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Similar to our <a href="#audiovideo">Audio &amp; Video Digitization</a>, timecapsl offers extremely high quality photo and document scanning services. With time, any precious moment caught on film, or an invaluable historical, legal, or sentimental document, can fade. These irreplaceable items should be reproduced in high-resolution digital form to preserve them from further degradation, as well as assure that they will be protected in the event of a fire, flood, or other calamity.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Our team will send a professional courier to your door to pick up these items and deliver them directly to our facility where we will scan them at print-quality resolutions. Once completed, our team will transfer them onto a disc and deliver everything back to you safely. Because collections can differ significantly in size and format, <a href="index.html#contact">please contact us today</a> to discuss pricing for your unique needs.</p>
